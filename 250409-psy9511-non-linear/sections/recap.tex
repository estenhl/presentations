\section{Recap}

\begin{frame}{Recap}
    Whenever a modelling choice is made on the basis of
    performance in a dataset, \textbf{we have to assume the
    performance achieved by the chosen model is inflated}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[!] Don't use a single train/validation split, cross-validation or bootstrapping with only train/validation sets to select the best model and then reports its performance
        \item[\textrightarrow] Hold out a test set
        \item[\textrightarrow] Use a nested cross-validation
        \item[\textrightarrow] Bootstrap train/validation/test sets
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
