            \textbf{Canvas}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item All relevant announcements will be made on Canvas (e.g. changes to assignments, lectures, interesting reading material etc.)
                \item Lecture slides and notebooks from live coding will be put on Canvas before/after a lecture

            \textbf{Curriculum}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The course uses the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning", found at \url{https://www.statlearning.com/}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Only some chapters will be used, they are posted on Canvas under each Lecture module
                    \item Although we won't be relying much on the exercises I \textbf{highly recommend} looking into them yourselves
                \end{itemize}
                \item I will add some scientific publications to the curriculum list as we go, depending on your preferences and interests
            \end{itemize}

            \textbf{Exercises}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The course has no exam, but six mandatory exercises you need to pass
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Mostly practical coding, with some reflection
                    \item Given with a \textbf{hard} deadline, unless there is a good reason for an extension
                    \item Can be delivered multiple times based on feedback (but the first must be in time for the original deadline)
                \end{itemize}
                \item Exercises 1-4 and 6 are mostly small and related to specific content of the preceding lecture, while 5 is a bit larger
                \item \textbf{You should hand in runnable code (e.g. a Jupyter notebook, a python script, an R script, Rmarkdown etc.), not code copied into a Word document or a pdf}
            \end{itemize}

            \textbf{Generative artificial intelligence (e.g. ChatGPT)}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You are allowed to use generative AI in the assignments, but you should state where and how
                \item Be critical, you should be able to understand and explain \textbf{all} the code you hand in
            \end{itemize}

            \textbf{Lectures}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Goal is to demonstrate central parts of the underlying theory in an \textbf{intuitive} manner
                \item $\sim$2 hours of lecturing, $\sim$1 hour for individual work/help with assignments
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item You will have to practice what you learn yourself
                \end{itemize}
                \item I will attempt to make lectures interactive, and do live coding where possible
